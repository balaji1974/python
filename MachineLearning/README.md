## Machine Learning
```xml
AI -> With AI computers are as good or better than humans in tasks 
Narrow AI -> Computers are as good or better than humans in a specific task
General AI ->Computers are as good or better than humans in more than one task

Machine Learning is a subset of AI, where computes act without being programmed 

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning 


When we use machines to predict results of incoming data, then this is called Machine Learning. 
They are of 3 types:
Supervised - Data with labels - eg. csv file with column names 
	classification  (grouping of categories)
	regression (based on inputs - eg. hire people - based on age, city, education etc)
UnSupervised - Data without labels - eg. csv file without column names
	clusting (grouping by machines)
	association rule learning (associate different parameter to predict outcomes)
Reinforced
